    <h2> Background on CSSI </h2>
      <p> I'm transitioning from high school into college, spending my summer studying computer science at the Google Campus in Mountain View!
        To say it is cool would be a bit of an understatement. The program is called CSSI, and it's goal is to give ingoing college freshmen all the compsci
        tools they need! Our days are spent learning code, exploring the Google Campus, and interacting with the Silicon Valley leaders of technlogy. Within the
        first week, alone, we learned five different programming languages, went on a Google scavenger hunt, explored all of San Francisco in a private (Google bought)
        trolley car. The more I'm here, the more I can envision myself spending my career coding. Google's company culture is insanely cool: dog friendly offices, 33 free
        cafes, bright colored bikes everyweher, and innovative, collaboritive offices. This page is meant to show off some of my new coding abilities and talk about
        my fun Google Adventures.

    <h2> What Have I been Up To? </h2>
      <p> We have learned four different coding languages in the past three days! I also got to tell the group about
        <strong>  <a href= "https://www.google.com"> Ears for years. </strong> </a> We went on a crazy scavenger hunt today all over
        the campus!
